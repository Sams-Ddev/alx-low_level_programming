i# Sams-Ddev's Repository - C More Singly Linked Lists

This repository contains C programs that implement various functionalities related to singly linked lists. The programs are part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the projects in this repository, you are expected to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. Gain proficiency in using linked lists in C.
2. Learn about algorithms and data structures.
3. Improve your ability to search for information and resources independently.
4. Familiarize yourself with important C coding guidelines.

## Projects

### 0. Print list

A function that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` linked list. The function returns the number of nodes in the list.

### 1. List length

A function that returns the number of elements in a `listint_t` linked list.

### 2. Add node

A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `listint_t` linked list.

### 3. Add node at the end

A function that adds a new node at the end of a `listint_t` linked list.

### 4. Free list

A function that frees a `listint_t` linked list.

### 5. Free list2

A function that frees a `listint_t` linked list and sets the head to NULL.

### 6. Pop

A function that deletes the head node of a `listint_t` linked list and returns the head node's data.

### 7. Get node at index

A function that returns the nth node of a `listint_t` linked list.

### 8. Sum list

A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) in a `listint_t` linked list.

### 9. Insert

A function that inserts a new node at a given position in a `listint_t` linked list.

### 10. Delete at index

A function that deletes the node at a given index in a `listint_t` linked list.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- The repository must have a `README.md` file at the root of the folder.
- The code should use the Betty style and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc. are forbidden.
- You are allowed to use the `_putchar` function.
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of `_putchar` should be included in a header file called `lists.h`.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
- All header files should be include guarded.

## Plagiarism Notice

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks by yourself. Copying and pasting someone else's work is not allowed. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Resources

You can use the following resources to learn and improve your understanding:

- Google
- YouTube

At the end of these projects, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, how to use linked lists and start looking for the right source of information without too much help.
