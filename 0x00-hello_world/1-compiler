#!/bin/bash
gcc -c $CFILE -o ${CFILE%.c}.o


# Script Explanation

: << 'COMMENT'
Sure, the command `gcc -c $CFILE -o ${CFILE%.c}.o` is used to compile a C source file and create an object file. The `-c` option tells the GCC compiler to only compile the source file and not to link it. The `-o` option specifies the output file name.

The `$CFILE` environment variable is a placeholder for the name of the C source file to compile. The `${CFILE%.c}.o` part of the command is used to generate the output file name. The `%` character is a special character that is used to extract the basename of the C source file. The `.o` extension is used to identify object files.  

For example, if the `CFILE` environment variable is set to the value `main.c`, then the `gcc -c $CFILE -o ${CFILE%.c}.o` command will compile the C source file `main.c` and create an object file named `main.o`.
Here is a breakdown of the command:

* `gcc` : The GCC compiler
* `-c` : Compile only
* `$CFILE` : The C source file to compile
* `-o` : The output file name
* `${CFILE%.c}.o` : The output file name, generated from the basename of the C source file and the `.o` extension
