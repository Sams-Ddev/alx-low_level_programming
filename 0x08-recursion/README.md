# Project Title

0x08. C - Recursion

## Description

This project focuses on understanding the concept of recursion in the C programming language. It covers the implementation of recursive functions and explores various aspects of using recursion effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

- Clone the repository from GitHub: [alx-low_level_programming](https://github.com/username/alx-low_level_programming)
- Navigate to the directory: `0x08-recursion`

## Topics Covered

The project covers the following topics:

- Introduction to recursion
- Implementing recursion
- Understanding when to use recursion
- Understanding when not to use recursion

## Files

The project consists of the following files:

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: A function that prints a string in reverse.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: A function that returns the length of a string.
- `3-factorial.c`: A function that returns the factorial of a given number.
- `4-pow_recursion.c`: A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.

## Requirements

The project has the following requirements:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- The code should use the Betty style and pass the `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` checks
- No global variables are allowed
- Each function should have no more than 5 functions per file
- The standard library should not be used, except for the function `_putchar`
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in the header file `main.h`
- No loops or static variables are allowed
