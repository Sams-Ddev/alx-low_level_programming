#Repository: alx-low_level_programming

##Project: 0x00-hello_world
This repository contains the solutions to tasks related to the C programming language. The tasks are designed to help you understand the basics of C programming and practice important concepts.

##Task Descriptions
0. Preprocessor
The task requires you to write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE, and the output should be saved in the file c.

1. Compiler
In this task, you need to write a script that compiles a C file but does not link it. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE, and the output file should be named the same as the C file but with the extension .o.

##General Requirements
The scripts and code files should be written in the C programming language.
The code should be compiled using gcc with the following flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
All code files should end with a new line.
The scripts should be executable.
The code should follow the Betty style, as specified in the betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl files.
