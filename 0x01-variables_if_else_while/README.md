#Low-Level Programming - Variables, if, else, while
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops. Each program focuses on a specific task and is described below:

##Task 0: Positive or Negative
File: 0-positive_or_negative.c
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It then determines whether the number stored in n is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result.

##Task 1: The Last Digit
File: 1-last_digit.c
This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It prints the last digit of the number stored in n and provides additional information based on the value of the last digit.

##Task 2: Print the Alphabet
File: 2-print_alphabet.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in a single line using the putchar function.

##Task 3: Print the Alphabet in Lowercase and Uppercase
File: 3-print_alphabets.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet followed by the uppercase alphabet, both in a single line, using the putchar function.

##Task 4: Print the Alphabet (Except 'q' and 'e')
File: 4-print_alphabt.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet excluding the letters 'q' and 'e' in a single line using the putchar function.

##Task 5: Print Single Digit Numbers
File: 5-print_numbers.c
This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 in a single line.

##Task 6: Print Single Digit Numbers (Without Using char Variables)
File: 6-print_numberz.c
This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 in a single line. It achieves this without using any variables of type char and by only using the putchar function.

##Task 7: Print the Alphabet in Reverse
File: 7-print_tebahpla.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order in a single line using the putchar function.

##Task 8: Print Hexadecimal Numbers
File: 8-print_base16.c
This program prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase in a single line using the putchar function.

##Task 9: Print Combinations of Single-Digit Numbers
File: 9-print_comb.c
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces, in ascending order. It achieves this by only using the putchar function and without using any variables of type char.

##Task 10: Print Different Combinations of Two Digits
File: 100-print_comb3.c
This advanced program prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by commas and spaces, in ascending order. It ensures that the two digits are different and avoids printing duplicate combinations such as 01 and 10. The program achieves this by only using the putchar function and without using any variables of type char.

Feel free to explore each task's file to understand the specific implementation details.
