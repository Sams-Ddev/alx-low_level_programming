## Introduction

This project focuses on bit manipulation in the C programming language. It covers various tasks related to working with individual bits in binary representation.

## Resources

- Google
- Youtube

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external help:

- Finding the right source of information
- Bit manipulation and bitwise operators

## Copyright - Plagiarism

- You are required to come up with solutions for the tasks to meet the learning objectives.
- Copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work is not allowed.
- Publishing any content of this project is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options.
- Your code should follow the Betty style and should not use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Only the `malloc`, `free`, and `exit` functions from the C standard library are allowed.
- The prototypes of all functions and `_putchar` should be included in a header file named `main.h`.
- All header files should have include guards.

## Tasks

### 0. Binary to Unsigned Int

Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

```c
unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
