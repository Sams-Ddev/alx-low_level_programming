# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

## Introduction

Welcome to the 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation project! In this project, you will learn and practice the fundamentals of bit manipulation and bitwise operators in the C programming language. By the end of this project, you will be able to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators without relying on external resources.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you are expected to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **General**
   - Develop the ability to find the right sources of information independently.
   - Gain proficiency in manipulating bits and using bitwise operators.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

Please note the following important guidelines regarding copyright and plagiarism:

- You must come up with solutions for the project tasks on your own to meet the learning objectives.
- Publishing any content from this project is strictly prohibited.
- Plagiarism in any form is not allowed and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- All your C files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Ensure that all your C files end with a newline character.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Each C file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- You are only allowed to use the following C standard library functions: `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. The use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`. There is no need to push `_putchar.c`; it will be provided.
- The prototypes of all your functions, including `_putchar`, should be included in your header file called `main.h`. Don't forget to push your header file.
- Ensure that all your header files are include guarded.

### Quiz Questions

Before moving on to the project tasks, validate your understanding by answering these quiz questions:

1. **Question #0**: `0x89 & 0x01 = ?`
   - [ ] 0x89
   - [ ] 0x01
   - [x] 0x88
   - [ ] 0x00

2. **Question #1**: What is 98 in base16?
   - [ ] 0x98
   - [x] 0x96
   - [ ] 0x62

3. **Question #2**: `0x01 << 1 = ?`
   - [ ] 0x03
   - [ ] 0x10
   - [ ] 0x01
   - [x] 0x02

(Continue to answer the remaining quiz questions...)
